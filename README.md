# 8-bit Converter
Convert a given audio file into an 8-bit-style rendition. 

Key features:
- I/O: Import audio files and export results with a preview.
- Data manipulation: Pitch-extraction, filtering, quantization, and resynthesis.
- UI/UX: Provide a clean and intuitive user interface both in CLI and GUI.
- Data Structures used for performance comparison.

## Usage
To use the converter, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the project directory:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Mingyu-Sun/8-bit-converter.git
    ```
2. In the project directory (make sure `pyproject.toml` presents), install the package in editable mode:
    ```shell
    pip install -e .
    ```
3. Now you can use `8_bit_cli` and `8_bit_gui` to invoke CLI and GUI from any directory.
